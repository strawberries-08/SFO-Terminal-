# SFO-Terminal 

**Key Insights and Interpretation:**

**1. Terminal 3 Dominance**
Terminal 3 consistently handled the highest passenger traffic for most of the observed period.
The traffic showed a cyclical pattern with seasonal peaks, particularly strong in the late 2010s.
A sharp drop occurs around 2020, corresponding to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

**2. Pandemic Impact (2020)**
All terminals saw a dramatic drop in passenger volume in early 2020.
This reflects the widespread travel restrictions and reduced air traffic due to COVID-19.
Gradual recovery is visible post-2021, though not all terminals returned to pre-pandemic levels.

**3. Terminal Trends**
International Terminal: Had steady growth up to 2019, significant pandemic impact, and moderate recovery.
Terminal 1 & 2: Follow a similar trend, with fluctuations indicating ongoing construction or airline shifts.
Terminal 3: More volatile but highest overall traffic.
Other: Represents minimal usage or inactive data; the flat line suggests it's either a minor facility or a placeholder for unclassified data.

**4. Long-Term Trends**
General growth is evident from the early 2000s to 2019, indicating increasing demand at SFO.
The trend lines highlight terminal-specific capacity usage and potential differences in airline allocations over time.
